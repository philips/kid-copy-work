# Kid Copy Work

These are tools I use to do "copy work" (take a photo) of my kid's works. I want to be able to do this a few times a year and be able to process hundreds of items in an hour or two. The reason for doing this project are to:

- Share works with family and friends
- Backup work in case of disaster
- Preserve work that might be fragile
- Reduce storage by recycling some work

Total cost in 2025 dollars $150 assuming you have a pocket terminal (e.g. iPhone or Android device):

- $99 - lights
- $22 - phone overhead mount
- $60 - any ol' tripod that will mount the overhead mount from the center post

## Prepare a Workspace

First, attach a pocket terminal (e.g. iPhone or Android device) to a tripod via an overhead mount (e.g. [Neweer DS009 Camera Mount](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1861081-REG/neewer_66604788_ds009_overhead_camera_mount.html)).

Light the area with two [Nanlite Compac 24B](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1664016-REG/nanlite_compac24bdt2k_compac_24b_adjustable_bicolor.html) placed on the ground and lighting at 45Â° to the work. Use white paperboard as a background.

Trigger the pocket terminal camera with a remote device (e.g. Apple Watch or Bluetooth device).

## Process Photos

Next, AirDrop the photos to me macOS computer.

Now, select the AirDrop'd photos via the "quick action" of "Remove Background".

Now setup this repo:

```
git checkout https://github.com/philips/kid-copy-work
cd kids-copy-work
python3 -m venv .venv --prompt kids-copy-work
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Move the photos with the backgrounds removed to the `in` directory in this git repo. Then run `python crop.py` which will crop the photos down to the bounding box of the work and add a white background. The photos will be in the `out` directory.



At the end you should have a nice clean photo of the work
